# Productive

You can see the result of the project in the following [link](https://glezgilcn.github.io/Productive/).

This project was inspired by the [Productive](https://productiveapp.io/) app, whose function is "Create healthy and
long-lasting habits".

This was my first Frontend project, using only **HTML, CSS** and **JavaScript**. The project focused on putting recently acquired knowledge into practice.

The web app was designed that shows a series of established habits, whether in the morning, afternoon or night; and that also change according to the day of the week.

The entire interface is done with HTML and CSS, while JS feeds the page with habits, which is why there is no chance to add a new habit or delete it.

For this, React.Js and Backend can be added to be able to have the user information and the app becomes dynamic and personalized.
